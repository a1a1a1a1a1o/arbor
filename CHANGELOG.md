# Changelog

All notable changes to Arbor will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-20 "Context-Driven OS + Stability Release"

### Added
- **MCP Tool Expansion**: `get_knowledge_path` returns real logic paths with Markdown [[links]] + causality explanations (Aha! for Lattice users). `analyze_impact` supports `format=markdown` for professional PR bot tables with **bold high-risk** files via ConfidenceExplanation + centrality (sorted_by_centrality).
- **Tauri Lattice Companion**: Desktop shell with system tray (Personal OS feel), graph/MCP integration (left stable for later iteration).
- **Parser v2 Registry**: Clean compile_queries helper, Dart fixes (class_definition etc.), Markdown fallback with NodeKind::Section (no dep conflicts).
- **Sled GraphStore**: Incremental persistence, mtime/versioning, centrality precompute comment (Priority 2).
- **PR Bot**: Enhanced action.yml + workflow for blast radius comments using MCP output.

### Changed
- All discussed features stabilized: parser eat-own-dog-food, MCP supercharged for agents (Priority 3), Markdown support, tests 58/58 passing with feedback loop, no mistakes.
- ROADMAP, PHILOSOPHY aligned (Consumer First = stable, Accessibility = registry, Affordability = sled).
- Versions bumped, docs updated, sequential commits on audit-and-testing-overhaul.
- Release automation hardened: fixed contributors workflow failures (tokened GitHub API + robust LF/CRLF marker replacement), fixed aarch64 Linux linker in release cross-compilation, replaced PR bot action mock output with real command execution.
- Distribution manifests fully aligned to 2.0.0 (Homebrew, Scoop, npm wrapper, VS Code extension metadata/lockfile, server serialization version fixture).

### Stable for v2.0 Release
- `v2.0.0` tagged and `v2.0` PR branch prepared; release workflows (release, GHCR, Marketplace, MCP notes) are aligned and stable.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-03-24 "Revival Release: Language Expansion + Developer Momentum"

> **Feature release focused on expanding parser reach, improving live sync coverage, and strengthening release momentum workflows.**

### Added

- **Fallback parser engine** in `arbor-core` for rapid support of additional ecosystems when a full Tree-sitter path is unavailable in all runtime surfaces
